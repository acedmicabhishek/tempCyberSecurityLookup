# MODULE 1: Data Communication and Networking Fundamentals

## Data Communication Components
Data communication involves the exchange of data between two devices via some form of transmission medium. A data communications system is made up of five components:
1.  **Message:** The information (data) to be communicated.
2.  **Sender:** The device that sends the data message.
3.  **Receiver:** The device that receives the message.
4.  **Transmission Medium:** The physical path by which a message travels from sender to receiver.
5.  **Protocol:** A set of rules that govern data communications.

## Representation of Data and its Flow in Networks
-   **Data Representation:** Information can be in the form of text, numbers, images, audio, and video. Text is represented as a bit pattern (a sequence of bits, 0s or 1s).
-   **Data Flow:** The direction of data transfer between two devices can be:
    -   **Simplex:** Communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street.
    -   **Half-duplex:** Each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.
    -   **Full-duplex:** Both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.

## Various Connection Topology
Network topology refers to the way in which a network is laid out physically. The four basic topologies are:
-   **Mesh:** Every device has a dedicated point-to-point link to every other device.
-   **Star:** Each device has a dedicated point-to-point link only to a central controller, or hub.
-   **Bus:** One long cable acts as a backbone to link all the devices in a network.
-   **Ring:** Each device has a dedicated point-to-point connection with only the two devices on either side of it.

## Protocols and Standards
-   **Protocols:** A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communications. It defines what is communicated, how it is communicated, and when it is communicated.
-   **Standards:** Standards are essential in creating and maintaining an open and competitive market for equipment manufacturers and in guaranteeing national and international interoperability of data and telecommunications technology and processes.

## OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a layered framework for the design of network systems that allows for communication between all types of computer systems. It has seven layers:
1.  **Physical Layer:** Coordinates the functions required to carry a bit stream over a physical medium.
2.  **Data Link Layer:** Transforms the physical layer, a raw transmission facility, to a reliable link.
3.  **Network Layer:** Responsible for the source-to-destination delivery of a packet, possibly across multiple networks.
4.  **Transport Layer:** Responsible for process-to-process delivery of the entire message.
5.  **Session Layer:** The network dialog controller. It establishes, maintains, and synchronizes the interaction among communicating systems.
6.  **Presentation Layer:** Concerned with the syntax and semantics of the information exchanged between two systems.
7.  **Application Layer:** Enables the user, whether human or software, to access the network.

## Physical Layer
### LAN Technologies (Ethernet)
Ethernet is a technology that is used to connect devices in a local area network (LAN). It is the most widely used LAN technology.

### Multiplexing
Multiplexing is a set of techniques that allows the simultaneous transmission of multiple signals across a single data link.

### Transmission Media
The transmission medium is the physical path by which a message travels from sender to receiver. It can be guided (e.g., twisted-pair cable, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable) or unguided (e.g., radio waves, microwaves).

### Switching Techniques
Switching is a method by which communication devices are connected to each other to allow the sharing of information. The two primary switching techniques are circuit switching and packet switching.
