# MODULE 5: Application Layer

## Application Layer Protocols
The application layer is the top layer of the OSI and TCP/IP models. It provides services directly to the user applications.

### DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses.

### SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
SMTP is a protocol for sending e-mail messages between servers. Most e-mail systems that send mail over the Internet use SMTP to send messages from one server to another.

### POP (Post Office Protocol)
POP is a protocol used by local e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a TCP/IP connection. POP3 is the version in common use.

### FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
FTP is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server.

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.

## Basics of Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices such as computers (laptops and desktops), mobile devices (smart phones and wearables), and other equipment (printers and video cameras) to interface with the Internet. Wi-Fi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance and is based on the IEEE 802.11 standards.
